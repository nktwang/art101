        	                    	<br>1.ignition
                                	<br>Description: The car ignition is controlled by the vehicle's internal computer, it consists of several systems together to get the vehicle started.
                                	<br>2.car shifter
                                	<br>Description: The gear shifter allows the vehicle to be put into different gears on a manual transmission.
                                	<br>3.car battery
                                	<br>Description:The standard automotive battery in today's vehicles is a 12-volt battery. Each battery has six cells, each with 2.1 volts at full charge. A car battery is considered fully charged at 12.6 volts or higher. When the battery's voltage drops, even a small amount, it makes a big difference in its performance.
                                	<br>4.car circuit link
                                	<br>Description: The electrical system of a car is a closed circuit with an independent power source the battery.
                                	<br>5.gasoline
                                	<br>Description: Gasoline also known as petrol is an energy-dense secondary fuel that can be thought of as an energy currency. It is used to power many heat engines, most importantly it acts as a fuel for a large proportion of cars.
                                	<br>6.auto fuses
                                	<br>Description: Car fuses are components designed to protect electrical wiring in cars and vehicles. They offer protection against overcurrent and short-circuiting, disconnecting the circuit if they detect a potentially dangerous level of current. They are also commonly known as automotive fuses.
                                	<br>7.car spark plug
                                	<br>Description:
                    	<p>After running the code of finding out the problem regarding fixing a car:
                                	<br>Either the car is successfully ignited,
                                	<br>Or the rescue or a professinaol staff is called to inspect the car.
